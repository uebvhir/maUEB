\item{colFC}{column referring to logFC (eg. "logFC")}

\item{FC}{logFC value to select genes}

\item{pltR}{to show or not the image in R}

\item{pltPdf}{to make or not the pdf}

\item{venn}{to perform or not the venn diagrams}

\item{eul}{to draw or not euler plot}

\item{upsetPlot}{to perform or not the upset plots. Normally when there are more than 5 comparisons or when this kind of plot is preferred}

\item{cex1}{size of the labels}

\item{rotation}{venn global rotation}

\item{position}{vector with the position in grades of each comparison label}

\item{cex2}{size of the numbers}

\item{hm_dataset}{Dataset with expression values to plot on heatmap}

\item{targets}{Targets file}

\item{featureCol}{Column in targets file corresponding to features (eg. "Gene.Symbol")}

\item{hm_comparNames}{name of set of comparisons (without spaces/dots/_). Usually the same as used for Venn (eg. venn_comparNames)}

\item{hm_compar}{list with set of comparisons to select genes to do the Heatmap, positions (or names) according to 'listofcoef' or 'listofTopNames'. Usually the same as used for Venn (eg. venn_compar)}

\item{hm_groupexclude}{samples to exclude in each set of comparisons for Heatmap (length must be equal to number of comparisons). If no sample is to be excluded put c()}

\item{hm_clustCol.dist}{required if hm_clustCol=TRUE: method for distance calculation in hierarchical clustering of samples (default in heatmap.2 is "euclidian")}

\item{hm_clustCol.method}{required if hm_clustCol=TRUE: method for hierarchical clustering (default in heatmap.2 is "complete", other may be "average")}

\item{hm_clustRow.cor}{whether to cluster gene expression based on distance correlation (otherwise distance matrix is calculated based on euclidian distance (default in heatmap.2 function))}

\value{
Plot Venn diagramm from 2 to 5 comparisons or UpsetR plot if >5 comparisons. Plot heatmap plots.
}
\description{
Plot Venn diagramm from 2 to 5 comparisons or UpsetR plot if >5 comparisons. It also plots heatmaps between the comparisons determined, with the thresholds values (p-value and logFC) of interest.
The Venn and Upset plots function is based in previous work of Ferran Brians√≥ and Miriam Mota ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgonzalo/GitBackupScripts/master/VennDiagrams/CreateVennEuler.R").
