\arguments{
\item{listofcsv}{list of the dataframes with the toptables}

\item{namescomp}{list with the names of each comparisons}

\item{label}{name that is going to appear in the file}

\item{colFeat}{column by which common genes are searched}

\item{colPval}{column to do the selection (normally Pvalue)}

\item{pval}{p-value by which the selection is done}

\item{colFC}{column referring to logFC (eg. "logFC")}

\item{FC}{logFC value to select genes}

\item{pltR}{to show or not the image in R}

\item{pltPdf}{to make or not the pdf}

\item{venn}{to perform or not the venn diagrams}

\item{eul}{to draw or not euler plot}

\item{upsetPlot}{to perform or not the upset plots. Normally when there are more than 5 comparisons or when this kind of plot is preferred}

\item{outputDir}{directory in which the results are going to be saved}

\item{venn_comparNames}{name of set of comparisons (without spaces/dots/_). Usually the same as used for Venn (eg. venn_comparNames)}

\item{venn_compar}{list with set of comparisons to select genes to do the Venn, positions (or names) according to 'listofcoef' or 'listofTopNames'. Usually the same as used for Venn (eg. venn_compar)}

\item{venn_pval}{column to do the selection (normally Pvalue)}

\item{venn_pval.thr}{p-value by which the selection is done}

\item{venn_logFC}{Name of column corresponding to logFC. Default is "logFC"}

\item{venn_logFC.thr}{logFC value to select genes}

\item{csv}{create the csv file with the common genes}
